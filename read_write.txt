SYNTAX FOR FILEEHANDLING IN PYTHON

file = open("sample.txt")
print(file.readline())      Prints only one line from the current position in the file

print(file.read())          Prints all the lines from the current position in the file

Remember to close the file

to do this it is easier to work with the "with" block of code

 with open('spamspam.txt', 'w', opener=opener) as f:
...     print('This will be written to somedir/spamspam.txt', file=f)

with open("sample.txt") aas file:
  for line in file :
    print(lien.upper())     Use .strip() to avoid printing multiple lines

  r+ read write mode
